### Who exactly you are and what Exactly it is that you do?
I'm an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loop-front) package (written in [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org) <3) that contains all the basic generic API request methods that loopback provide, I also dispatch [redux actions](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions#actions) on the basis of API request you made.
